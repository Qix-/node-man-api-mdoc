> MDoc extensions for man-api

This is probably the module you're looking for.

This module extends [`man-api`](https://github.com/qix-/node-man-api) and adds
support for MDoc macros. These macros, while originally BSD specific, are now
in use in most linux distros and support much finer grained documentation
macros for programming languages.
